			This shows how long a dictionary attack would take to crack your password! <br>
			The dictionary we use contains 318,971 different passwords. <br>
			It compares your password to a dictionary of common passwords. If there is a match, your password will be cracked.  <br>
			Some hackers have computers that can make <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/12/25-gpu-cluster-cracks-every-standard-windows-password-in-6-hours/"> 350,000,000,000 guesses per second! </a> <br>
			This would exhaust our entire dictionary immediately! <br>
			Note that just because the password you entire isn't in our dictionary, that doesn't mean it's 100% safe. <br>
			Just because we're missing "apple123" doesn't mean you should start using it as your password! <br>
