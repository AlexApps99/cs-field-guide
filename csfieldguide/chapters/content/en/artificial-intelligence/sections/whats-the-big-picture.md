# What's the big picture?

Artificial Intelligence (also known as {glossary-link term="intelligent-systems"}intelligent systems{glossary-link end}) is about creating and analysing machines and computer systems that act intelligently, or demonstrate intelligence.
As well as building artificially intelligent systems, AI research can be about studying intelligence in natural systems.

But what do we actually mean by intelligence?
Computers can do a lot of impressive things, like search billions of webpages in milliseconds, or take some code you wrote and run a game, but does that make them truly intelligent?
What differentiates an intelligent computer system from any other computer program?

AI is primarily a branch of computer science but it has borrowed a lot of concepts and ideas from other fields, especially [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) (particularly logic, combinatorics, statistics, probability and optimisation theory), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology), [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics), [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy).

There are many different subfields of AI and approaches to building intelligent systems. These approaches can generally be split into two groups: rule-based techniques, and machine learning techniques.
Intelligent systems can be built using either of these, or a combination.
In this chapter we'll explore both rule-based expert systems and machine learning techniques, how these work, and what they are used for.

Inevitably discussing AI will mean dealing with ethical and philosophical issues too &ndash; do we really want machines to take over some of our jobs?
Can we trust them?
Might it all go too far one day?
What do we really mean by a computer being intelligent?
While we won't address these questions directly in this chapter, gaining some technical knowledge about AI will enable you to make more informed decisions about the deeper issues.
