# What's the big picture?

AI (also known as {glossary-link term="intelligent-systems"}intelligent systems{glossary-link end}) is primarily a branch of computer science but it has borrowed a lot of concepts and ideas from other fields, especially [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) (particularly logic, combinatorics, statistics, probability and optimisation theory), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology), [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics), [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy).

It is about creating and analysing machines and computer systems that act intelligently, or demonstrate intelligence. These machines and systems are often referred to as computational {glossary-link term="agent"}agents{glossary-link end}.
But what do we actually mean by intelligence?
Computers can do a lot of impressive things, like search billions of webpages in miliseconds, or take some code you wrote and run a game, but does that make them truly intelligent?

In the field of AI, an agent is generally considered to be intelligent if it:

- mimics elements of human intelligence, such as problem solving and learning, or
- can interpret external data, and take actions which then move it towards a particular goal.

There are many different subfields of AI and approaches to building intelligent systems. These approaches can generally be split into two groups: rule-based techniques, and machine learning techniques.
Intelligent systems can be built using either of these, or a combination.
In this chapter we'll explore both rule-based systems and machine learning techniques, how these work, and what they are used for.

Inevitably discussing AI will mean dealing with ethical and philosophical issues too &ndash; do we really want machines to take over some of our jobs?
Can we trust them?
Might it all go too far one day?
What do we really mean by a computer being intelligent?
While we won't address these questions directly in this chapter, gaining some technical knowledge about AI will enable you to make more informed decisions about the deeper issues.
