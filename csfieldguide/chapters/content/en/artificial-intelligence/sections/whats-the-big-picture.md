# What's the big picture?

AI (also known as {glossary-link term="intelligent-systems"}intelligent systems{glossary-link end}) is primarily a branch of computer science but it has borrowed a lot of concepts and ideas from other fields, especially [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics) (particularly logic, combinatorics, statistics, probability and optimisation theory), [biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biology), [psychology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology), [linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistics), [neuroscience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience) and [philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy).

The concepts behind AI systems have been around for a long time, but as... data and computational power increased, the capability/power of AI systems has drastically grown (or maybe this only applies to some forms?)

There are many different subfields of AI and approaches to building intelligent systems. These approaches can generally be split into two groups: rule-based techniques, and machine learning techniques.
Intelligent systems can be built using either of these, or a combination.
In this chapter we'll explore both rule-based systems and machine learning techniques, how these work, and what they are used for.



Inevitably this will mean dealing with ethical and philosophical issues too &ndash; do we really want machines to take over some of our jobs?
Can we trust them?
Might it all go too far one day?
What do we really mean by a computer being intelligent?
While we won't address these questions directly in this chapter, gaining some technical knowledge about AI will enable you to make more informed decisions about the deeper issues.
