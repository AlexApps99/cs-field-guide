# The Evolution of AI

AI is a field which has evolved since its inception in the 1950's, and as technology in this area advances, the goals and core theories of AI continue to change.
Initially it was defined as the ability of a computational machine to simulate the abilities of humans.

"Intelligence" was described in terms of human intelligence, and what we are capable of doing.
For example, our ability to communicate via speech.
Many humans take for granted the fact that they can easily have a conversation with another person, and choose appropriate things to say based on the conversation.
<!-- The ability to do this is a form of intelligence, and for computers it isn’t so easy! -->

<!-- Overtime the idea of what makes a machine intelligent has shifted from mimicing humans, to... -->


## The Turing Test

<!-- Maybe turn this into a curiosity panel? -->
The Turing test, originally named the Imitation Game, is a famous Artificial Intelligence experiment, that was developed by the Computer Scientist Alan Turing in 1950.
He proposed this test as a way to determine if a computer truly was intelligent.
To pass the Turing test, a computer program must convince a human that it is also a human by having a conversation with them.
While having a simple conversation seems like a very easy thing to do to us humans, it is actually an extremely complicated thing for a computer to do.
Correctly interpreting what someone says to you, and choosing appropriate things to say based on the conversation is a form of intelligence.
Defining intelligence as having this ability is what Turing based his test on.

In the test one human, called the interrogator, has a conversation via text (e.g. written notes or online messaging) with another human, and with an AI program.
Text, rather than sound, is used so that the computer doesn’t need to simulate human speech.
The interrogator knows they are speaking to one human and one AI program, but does not know which is which.
Throughout these conversations both the other human and the AI are trying to convince the interrogator that they are the human.
If at the end of the conversations the interrogator is not sure which of their conversation partners is the human (or they guess that the AI is the human!) then the AI program is said to have passed the test, and proven that it is intelligent.

As of the time this chapter was written, no computer program has officially passed the test, but some have been claimed to pass it in [specific circumstances](https://www.cnet.com/news/alphabet-chairman-says-google-duplex-passes-turing-test-in-one-specific-way-io-2018/).
The Turing test however only measures one particular form of intelligence.

The Turing Test is one of the most significant developments in the history of AI, but as time has gone on the AI field has moved away from trying to create systems which can pass this test, and instead towards systems that can interact effectively with humans (regardless of whether they seem human or not), perform as well as, or better than humans at certain tasks, and can solve complex problems that are extremely time consuming, difficult, or even impossible for humans.
AI is no longer focussed on making machines that can imitate humans, but rather machines that can do things intelligently, and can assist humans by solving problems that we find difficult.

## Weak AI vs Strong AI

**Weak AI**, also known as narrow AI, are designed and trained for performing very specific tasks.
They operate in a specific environment, and have a predefined range of functions that they can perform.
These systems are said to *simulate* intelligence, and act as though they are intelligent.
Some examples of weak AI systems are:

- Autonomous vacuum cleaners
- Game playing computer programs, like chess-playing computers
- Medical diagnosis systems that use AI algorithms
- Personal assistants, like Siri or Alexa
- Chatbots on websites that help answer customers questions
- Self driving cars

On the other hand **Strong AI**, also known as general AI, would instead be systems that could *actually* think.
They would be able to exhibit human intelligence and apply it to novel situations.
This doesn’t mean machines that are necessarily as smart as the smartest humans, but systems that simulate the qualities of intelligence, such as being able to think abstractly, plan, think creatively, adapt to new environments, and solve problems in unpredictable situations.
At this point in time, strong AI has not been achieved, and many people question if it will ever be possible.
Examples of this may not exist in reality, but science fiction is full of them:
<!-- Need to check if these would still be relatively well known to students... -->

- R2-D2, BB-8, and C-3PO from Star Wars
- The hosts in the TV series Westworld
- Baymax from Big Hero 6
- The replicants in the Blade Runner films
- The android Data in Star Trek

Despite the name, weak AI systems do some incredible things, and make up all AI systems we use today.
The difference between weak and strong AI is mainly the different situations they can be applied to.

# Artificial Super Intelligence

Beyond strong AI there is also the idea of Artificial Super Intelligence. This is a hypothetical form of machine intelligence that would surpass that of humans in every cognitive domain, whether it is problem-solving, mathematical thinking, creativity, or even social interpersonal skills. Some people believe that if this level of AI was ever created, it could spell the end of the human species. But since right now we are nowhere near creating AI that exhibits general intelligence, this probably isn’t something you need to worry about too much!

## Non-learning Expert Systems

Expert systems, sometimes referred to as rule-based systems, are probably the simplest form of AI used (and not everyone considers them a form of AI anymore), but they can still be powerful, particularly when used in conjunction with other AI techniques.
They have been used for many purposes, such as diagnosing medical conditions, creating game playing AI's, and simulating human conversation.

These systems are designed to simulate the decision making ability of a human-expert in a specific domain.
They operate by following a set of pre-programmed rules, or logical statements.

- Follow predefined and preprogrammed rules
- Do not learn
- Abilities are entirely dependent on the knowledge of the designers and programmers
