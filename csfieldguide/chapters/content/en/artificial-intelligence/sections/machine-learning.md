# Machine Learning

While the rule-based systems we looked at previously can be used to solve complex problems, they are limited as they can only use the specific knowledge that they are given.
They follow a pre-determined set of rules...
Machine learning systems on the other hand do not rely solely on their existing knowledge. As the name suggests, systems built with machine learning algorithms *can learn*.

The concepts behind Machine learning systems have been around for a long time, but as... data and computational power increased, the capability/power of these systems has drastically grown.




What it is...

- Intelligent systems that use machine learning techniques are called learning Systems
- Do not start with a fixed set of knowledge/rules, but build these themselves


Commonly used for...

- Supervised Learning... uses, pros, cons
- Unsupervised Learning... uses, pros, cons

Particular focus - Neural networks (since they're the big thing at the moment)

Any other examples
- Google Deep-mind, Alpha-Go
- Any Microsoft examples for balance?
