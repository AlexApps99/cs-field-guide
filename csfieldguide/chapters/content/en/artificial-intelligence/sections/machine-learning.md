# Machine Learning

What it is...

- Intelligent systems that use machine learning techniques are called learning Systems
- As you can probably tell from the name, these systems `learn`
- Do not start with a fixed set of knowledge/rules, but build these themselves


Commonly used for...

- Supervised Learning... uses, pros, cons
- Unsupervised Learning... uses, pros, cons

Particular focus - Neural networks (since they're the big thing at the moment)

Any other examples
- Google Deep-mind, Alpha-Go
- Any Microsoft examples for balance?
