# Machine Learning

<!-- - Techniques and algorithms used to make intelligent agents intelligent -->

<!-- While the rule-based systems we looked at previously can be used to solve complex problems, they are limited as they can only use the specific knowledge that they are given. -->
<!-- Machine learning systems on the other hand do not rely solely on their existing knowledge. -->


As the name suggests, systems built with machine learning algorithms *can learn*.

The concepts behind Machine learning (ML) systems have been around for a long time, but as... data and computational power increased, the capability/power of these systems has drastically grown.
It is now a massive area of research, marketing and business.
It has been applied to a huge range of fields and problems, like fraud detection, speech recognition, and even diagnosing serious medical conditions.

Add in more about ML in business and how influential it has been...

Do not start with a fixed set of knowledge/rules, but build these themselves...


There are three main types of Machine Learning that we will cover in this chapter:

- Reinforcement learning
- Supervised learning
- Unsupervised learning

Each of these types of ML are suited to different problems and data analysis methods, and a ML system may use one, or a combination of these to achieve its goals.
There is also a fourth type, called semi-supervised learning, which we wont be covering in detail.

Along with these different types, there are a range of different algorithms, or models, that are used for ML.
Some are best suited to just one type, for example ...
while others, such as Artificial Neural Networks, can be constructed in ways that support all three of these learning types.
Multiple algorithms are also often combined within one system.
<!-- These are also frequently combined with rule-based algorithms, or used to generate rule based systems. -->
This is because ML can be applied to a multitude of different problems, each of which has specific constraints and goals.
Using a combination of different techniques and algorithms can sometimes produce much better results than using just one (but not always!)

The next following sections will cover each of the main types of ML, the problems they are each used to solve, and some of the most commonly used algorithmic models for ML.
