# Machine Learning

- Techniques and algorithms used to make intelligent agents intelligent

While the rule-based systems we looked at previously can be used to solve complex problems, they are limited as they can only use the specific knowledge that they are given.
Machine learning systems on the other hand do not rely solely on their existing knowledge.
As the name suggests, systems built with machine learning algorithms *can learn*.

The concepts behind Machine learning systems have been around for a long time, but as... data and computational power increased, the capability/power of these systems has drastically grown.

What it is...

- Intelligent systems that use machine learning techniques are called learning Systems
- Do not start with a fixed set of knowledge/rules, but build these themselves

Three main types, each of which are suited to different types of problems.

*Diagram here*

There are many algorithms used for ML, and multiple algorithms are often combined within one system.
These are also frequently combined with rule-based algorithms, or used to generate rule based systems.
This is because AI can be applied to a multitude of different problems, each of which has speific constraints and goals.
Using a combination of different techniques and algorithms can sometimes produce much better results than using just one.

The next three sections cover each of the main types of ML, the problems they are each used to solve, and the most common algorithms used to solve these.
