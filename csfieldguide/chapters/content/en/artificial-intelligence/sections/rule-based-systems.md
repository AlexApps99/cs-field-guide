# Expert Systems

Expert systems, also referred to as rule-based expert systems, are probably the simplest form of AI used, but they can still be extremely powerful.
They have been used for many purposes, such as diagnosing medical conditions, creating game playing AI's and, as will explore in this chapter, simulating human conversation.

These systems are designed to simulate the decision making ability of a human-expert in a specific domain.

 - write some kind of example. "Think of..."

- considered by some to not actually be a form of AI
- Has a fixed set of knowledge/rules that it then applies. Rigid intelligence
- Follows a pre-determined set of rules, which it uses to make decisions about input data.
- Simplest form of AI

<!-- Comic for this https://xkcd.com/1696/ -->

Started from the idea that you could represent human knowledge as simple rules. If this then that.


Commonly used for...

Examples...

- Use chatbots as examples in this
- A rule based interactive or set of instructions for something simple like tic tac toe? Easy to base on the unplugged actvities
- Decision trees to classify an animal?


What they are good at and not so good at...

- Narrow intelligence
- focus on doing a small range of tasks well.




## Chatterbots

...


## Game stuff? Medical diagnosis?

Short note on how these are sometimes combined with ML, generally with ML algorithms which produce rule based systems.

- ML that produces decision trees
