# Intelligent Agents

Artificial Intelligence (also known as {glossary-link term="intelligent-systems"}intelligent systems{glossary-link end}) is about creating and analysing machines and computer systems that act intelligently, or demonstrate intelligence. These machines and systems are often referred to as {glossary-link term="agent"}*computational agents*{glossary-link end}.

An agent is simply something which executes actions within an environment, which is a very broad definition! It can apply to many things &ndash; robots, cats, air-conditioning units, and humans.
If the decisions and actions made by an agent can be broken down into computational steps (i.e. steps which could be implemented by programming a device) then it is referred to as a *computational* agent.
<!-- Could add some stuff here about natural vs artificial intelligent agents -->
For simplicity, throughout the rest of this chapter we will use the term *agent* to refer specifically to agents made up of digital systems, such as computers and robots.

Not all agents are thought to be intelligent. In the field of AI, an agent is generally considered to act intelligently if:

- It can mimic elements of human intelligence, such as problem solving and learning, or
- It can interpret external data collected from its environment, takes appropriate actions that move it towards it's goals, whilst taking into account the future consequences of these actions.
- It has the ability to learn from data and past experience, and then make predictions and decisions based on this and its existing knowledge.

For example, a robot that... could be called an intelligent agent, while one that... definitely would not be!
