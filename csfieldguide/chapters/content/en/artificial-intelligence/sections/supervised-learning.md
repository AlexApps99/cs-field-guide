# Supervised Learning

The core goal of supervised learning is to assign values or categories to previously unseen data.

Supervised learning algorithms are trained and tested using labelled sets of data.
A data set is made up of many individual *observations*, and in labelled data sets each of these examples is, as you may have deduced, *labelled*!
For example consider the following excerpt from a data set: *Add note here about it being a real data set*

| **Observation** | **BMI** | **Blood pressure** | **Age** | **Has high cholesterol** |
|-----------------|:-------:|:------------------:|:-------:|:------------------------:|
| Person 1        | 20.68   | 96/63              | 49      | False                    |
| Person 2        | 30.47   | 280/11             | 65      | True                     |
| Person 3        | 23.59   | 119/78             | 46      | True                     |
| ...             | ...     | ...                | ...     | ...                      |
| Person 5,000    | 22.15   | 116/69             | 63      | False                    |


In this data set each observation is labelled with either true or false (or 1 and 0) depending on whether that person has high cholesterol.
This set of data can be used to train, and test the accuracy of a supervised learning algorithm.
One this system has been trained it can then be used to *predict* if new people have high cholesterol, from new observations.
