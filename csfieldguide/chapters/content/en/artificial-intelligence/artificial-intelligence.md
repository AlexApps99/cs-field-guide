# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial intelligence conjures up all sorts of images &ndash; perhaps you think of friendly systems that can talk to you and solve tough problems; or maniac robots that are bent on world domination?
There's the promise of driverless cars that are safer than human drivers, and the worry of medical advice systems that hold people's lives in their virtual hands.
The field of {glossary-link term="artificial-intelligence"}artificial intelligence{glossary-link end}, or AI, is a field of computer science that has been around since the 1950's, but has rapidly grown in popularity in recent years, as access to large data sets and high performance computers has dramatically increased.

<!--- Check if this is technically correct, might be more accurate to say it's just it's use that has spread, or if it has always been popular and just is more common place now--->
Its use has spread to almost every industry, and these days it is almost impossible to build large or complex systems without them containing some forms of AI programming, or AI based concepts.
<!--- is a part of computer science that has a lot of promise and also raises a lot of concerns.--->
It can be used to make decisions in systems as large as an aeroplane or an autonomous dump truck, or as small as a mobile phone that accurately predicts text being typed into it. <!--- Change examples of the large systems--->
What these systems have in common is that they try to mimic aspects of human intelligence.
You probably interact with some form of AI on a daily basis!
And importantly, such systems can be of significant help in people's everyday lives.
